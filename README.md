# Golf game

## About

Between the first semester and the second one at Warsaw University of Technology, I've decided to take up the biggest 
project I've done so far. Just because I love maths and physics, I've decided to make a game that makes use of
that knowledge. Golf game uses it all. Everything but audio is made by myself.

The only technologies I used are **Python** and **pygame**.

## How to run it

First of all, if you do not wish to clone the repository and follow instructions below, you can simply watch a little video I recorder that previews most of the features I've implemented. You can click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SookIx5zcTM), to get to youtube and watch it.

Firstly, make sure you've got python installed! Then, clone the repository and do as follows:

```
pip install pygame
cd Golf-minigame
python main.py
```

## Instruction

The game is self-explanatory. All you need to know is that you can reset level with `R` and go back to main menu with 
`ESC` key. To move your ball you basically need to _draw_ a vector.

If you find a bug, just let me know. I will fix it right away!
